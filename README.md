# EAS501 - Project
The code and the output for Simulation can be found [here](https://github.com/ChaakuDaaku/EAS502-Project/blob/master/project.ipynb).

The data from the simulation is stored in [data.csv](https://github.com/ChaakuDaaku/EAS502-Project/blob/master/data.csv), which can be used to generate even more insights if needed.

There are MATLAB files which provide analytical solution to strategies 1 & 3.
